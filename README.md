After graduating from the university with a bachelor's degree in biology and biotechnology, I began working as an administrator in the finance department of an engineering firm, where I picked up new and exciting skills. Over the course of my career, I developed an interest in web apps, which led to my learning to code. I'm excited at the chance to make a difference by working as part of a team to solve big problems.
